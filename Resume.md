## RELEVANT EXPERIENCE

**Gas Turbine Engineering Intern**  
*EthosEnergy, Turin, Italy — Summer 2025*  
- Performed thermal-fluid analysis on 6FA gas turbine and 9FA compressor using AxSTREAM, optimizing performance parameters based on blade geometry profiles.  
- Developed detailed turbine and compressor blade profiles in AxSlice, integrating them into AxSTREAM for simulation and identifying geometric inconsistencies affecting flow accuracy.  
- Conducted 3D scan alignment and blade deviation analysis in ZEISS Inspect; used ANSYS SpaceClaim to reconstruct full rotor blades from partial scans for further analysis.  
- Led a design study evaluating the impact of inlet and outlet metal angles on blade efficiency by comparing automated and manual profiling in AxSlice; used Excel and simulation results to quantify a 2.36% performance error from real data, demonstrating high accuracy and informing workflow improvements.  
- Proposed innovative methods to accelerate turbine design workflows, including surrogate modeling with machine learning to speed up AxSTREAM iterations and plans to automate ANSYS post-processing for thermal-structural simulations, reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency.

**Senior Design Capstone**  
*Geometric Modeling of Flagella in Single-Cell Organisms — August 2024 – May 2025*  
- Developed novel mathematical equations for force, torque, and power output for flagella interacting with the fluid, deriving equations of motion directly from geometric parameters such as curvature and torsion.  
- Designed an innovative extension to the Immersed Boundary Method to add dimensionality to flagellar shapes, enabling further analysis of perturbation and dynamics in fluid-interacting models for helical geometries.
